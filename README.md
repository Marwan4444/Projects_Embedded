## 📁 Project List

### 1️⃣ **ATMega32**
- 🔹 `smart_roomArduino`  
  A smart room system using ATmega32 to control lights and temperature automatically.

---

### 2️⃣ **Smart_Home**
- 🔹 `kitchen_hood_PIC16`  
  A kitchen hood automation project using PIC16 to adjust fan speed based on temperature levels.

---

### 3️⃣ **Control_temperture**
- 🔹 A basic temperature monitoring and control system using analog sensors.

---

### 4️⃣ **LED_binary_Control**
- 🔹 A binary LED control system to display numbers in binary using simple logic and buttons.

---

### 5️⃣ **counter_sixth7_seg**
- 🔹 A counter with a 7-segment display, using push buttons or PIR sensors to increment/decrement.

---

### 6️⃣ **PIC18**
- 🔹 `Traffic Light`  
  A full traffic light control system using PIC18F.  
  Includes LED sequencing with timing logic for Red, Yellow, and Green lights. Ideal for simulating a junction.
